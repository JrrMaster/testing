1
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:52,280
Publishing and production companies

2
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:52,280
are the same, so the series is a-okay.

3
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:25,790
10 cm distance matters!

4
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:25,790
Didn't you know?

5
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:38,260
Haven't seen a new meme for a while...

6
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:38,260
But, so much fatter now.

7
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:38,260
I wouldn't have cared in my younger years.

8
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:17,510
I thought people might be tired of it already,

9
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:17,510
but it's so damn cute so I took it out again...

10
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:34,670
I personally like Kinryuu much more,

11
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:34,670
but for the memes' sake...

12
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:34,670
That reminds me,

13
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:34,670
haven't seen Van Damme
for a while now.

14
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:05,400
U~I~HA~

15
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,360
RU~!

16
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,320
Are you wearing your panties?

17
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,960
Sa-Saten-san!  I...  I am!

18
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,010
Really?

19
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,520
I am!

20
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,430
Really?

21
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,020
I am!

22
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,040
Really?

23
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,940
I am...?

24
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:28,000
More Complete Railgun

25
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,090
Thanks for waiting.

26
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,430
Here you go.  The last one.

27
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:39,890
Ew...  I don't want that...

28
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:44,700
U-Um...  Do you want it?

29
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:48,960
R-really?!

30
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,540
What, sis?

31
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:59,550
The smell of death looms, loo loo loo.

32
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:04,370
The wind roars.

33
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,260
Her presence wasn't detectable at all.

34
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:21,260
Indeed...

35
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:25,730
I heard some interesting rumors about the dorm manager a while ago.

36
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:27,970
I looked up postings on the Internet!

37
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,560
I looked up postings on the Internet!

38
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,480
That dorm manager is actually...

39
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:36,500
Manga "B.B" reference.

40
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:37,910
Runba!

41
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,320
Judgment!

42
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:42,740
Knight!

43
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,960
Jalapeño.

44
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:51,590
She had such a past, apparently.

45
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,920
What?!

46
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,060
T-that sounds so fake...  E-even for her...

47
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,510
Yeah!  Of course it can't be true.

48
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:05,810
It is true!  A friend of an acquaintance said so!

49
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:08,940
Yeah!  It's on the Internet so it must be true!

50
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,270
"Sleeping  Sheep"

51
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,100
And it's about a "Sleeping something".

52
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,290
Right?

53
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:16,900
Burning Blood

54
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,940
And that American soldier name "Burning something".

55
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,480
Yeah, yeah.  "Excessive self-defense", right?

56
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,790
Right?

57
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:20,870
Is this...  For real...?

58
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:23,610
I'm s-s-scared...

59
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,560
I wanna eat a shibazuke.

60
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,700
So to sum it up.

61
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,180
In Academy City's current curriculum for power development,

62
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,170
The most important concept is "personal reality".

63
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,270
To put it simply...

64
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,470
Here.

65
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,870
A box with a cat alive in it.

66
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:56,730
However!

67
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:02,200
When the cover opens, what would have happened to the cat?

68
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,370
Do you know, Saten?

69
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,340
A-ah!

70
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,660
It could be dead or not dead.

71
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,500
Let's find out!

72
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:17,510
SF Revival!

73
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,690
Cheers!

74
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,090
Cheers!

75
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:32,520
A cup after work is just so damn awesome!

76
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,810
Let's start BBQing!

77
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:36,860
Meat!

78
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:41,990
No meat for the Anti-Skill that does nothing but cause trouble!

79
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,610
No way!

80
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:49,040
Don't worry.  You can still get meat even if all you do is cause trouble.

81
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:53,720
For you see, today we have ourselves the prestigious BBQ set!

82
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,810
Komoe-sensei...

83
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:59,470
Time to toss them on and stuff them down!

84
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:03,360
Yomikawa-sensei, can you pass me the sauce please?

85
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,180
Sauce!

86
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,640
Can't eat BBQ without the sauce!

87
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,950
Agreed!

88
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,170
You like "jan" a lot, huh?

89
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,460
And not just these.

90
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,690
For action stars, there's Jean-Claude Van Damme.

91
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,700
For boy inventors, there's Jean.

92
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,560
For mahjong, there's jankyu.

93
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,830
For a crude fate, there's Jean Valjean.

94
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,410
My favorite stuff's got "jan" all over!

95
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:26,690
And there're more!

96
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:28,000
For paintings, there's Jean Cocteau.

97
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,190
For cooking, there's Akiyama Jan.

98
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,290
Manga's got Jump.

99
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:32,940
For teatime, there's Jean-Paul Hévin!

100
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:37,700
Windmills, Holland, who dat?

101
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,600
Among those marching on Kabukicho,

102
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,630
There's a Hollander in a skirt<i>!!

103
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,790
Hey Kuroko...

104
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:47,430
What now, sis?

105
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:52,140
Doesn't Academy City have a whole lot of wind turbines?

106
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,600
I guess.

107
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,060
Are those wind turbines... really making electricity?

108
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:04,320
Even Holland doesn't have that many wind turbines!

109
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:09,280
Geez, what makes you say that?

110
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,530
I've heard about this.

111
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:17,070
All the randomly built wind turbines in Japan are gonna be taken down.

112
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:20,360
But these turbines are spinning fine though.

113
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,370
They're wind turbines!  Wind turbines!

114
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,790
This is Academy City!  Academy City!

115
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:29,100
How can they be enough?!  And with what wind?  We're inland!

116
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,000
Spinning fine?!  You think it's mountain wind?  You serious?!

117
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,400
That's total rubbish!

118
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,450
So this is what I think.

119
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:41,920
Maybe these turbines are spinning using electricity and not making any!

120
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,900
Say what now?!

121
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:49,450
Sis, please don't be silly.

122
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:53,330
I'm deadly serious!  Something's not right here.

123
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:56,240
This city is definitely hiding something!

124
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,290
A conspiracy?  Government secrets?!

125
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:01,170
Those turbines are a part of the government's secret plan!

126
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:04,050
And if my deduction is correct!

127
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:08,130
It's the first step of the Mars migration project: Exodus.

128
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,850
I saw it on an online post.

129
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,930
I heard rumors too!

130
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:17,370
How...  How could this be...

131
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:21,060
But only those chosen can escape...

132
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,820
I'm only a level 0 so...

133
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,560
Saten-san, it's nothing like that.

134
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,160
But can mankind alone carry out such a plan?

135
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,340
Extraterrestrials!

136
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:36,120
Greys are definitely involved!

137
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,620
Ah!  The color grey, huh?!

138
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:41,910
Stupid, stupid!  Not the color!  Stupid, stupid!

139
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:43,110
The color grey, huh?

140
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,440
Stupid, stupid!

141
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,520
The color grey, huh?

142
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,810
Stupid, stupid!

143
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:47,920
The color grey, huh?

144
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,950
Stupid, stupid!

145
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:43,330
My dear sis, please calm down.

146
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,780
This is Academy City after all.

147
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,950
I wouldn't be surprised no matter what happens here.

148
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,190
Oh yeah, of course!  This is Academy City after all!

149
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,640
Yeah!

150
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,300
Yes!  Yes!  Sauce!

151
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,030
Yes!  Yes!  Sauce!

152
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,420
This is Academy City.

153
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:14,700
A city occupied by 2.3 million students.

154
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:18,560
Nothing that happens here is a surprise.

155
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,120
To be continued

156
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,700
Dear my friend

157
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:27,430

158
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,040

Please conserve electricity, 'kay?  Biri~biri~

Please conserve electricity, 'kay?  Buri~buri~❤

162

Please conserve electricity, 'kay?!  DONG!  DONG!

163
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:55,620
Please conserve electricity, 'kay?  *sniff sniff*

164
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:01,620
Reduce CO2 emission:  Breathe less.
